Hello 😃, Welcome ✌ to MindCare.
🤍✔
MindCare is a mental health care open source project that is designed to provide individuals with access to professional mental health care at an affordable price. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to prioritize their mental health, regardless of their financial situation. To that end, we have developed a range of mental health resources and tools that are available to the public for free or at a reduced cost. Our offerings include online assessments, educational materials, support forums, and a directory of mental health professionals. We are committed to creating a welcoming and supportive community where individuals can connect with others and access the resources they need to improve their mental health and well-being.

>>>>>Here are some of our core values for a MindCare:

**Inclusivity: We believe that everyone should have access to mental health resources and support, regardless of their background or financial situation.

**Empathy: We are committed to understanding and responding to the unique needs of each individual who seeks support through our project.

**Professionalism: We strive to provide the highest quality mental health resources and support, and to maintain the highest standards of professionalism in all of our   interactions.

**Non-judgment: We believe that mental health is a complex and personal matter, and we strive to create a safe and welcoming space where individuals can share their     experiences without fear of judgment.

**Sustainability: We are committed to developing resources and tools that are sustainable and can be used by individuals over the long term to support their mental       health.

**Innovation: We are constantly seeking out new and innovative ways to support the mental health of our community members and improve our offerings.

My Name is Adeeko Tobiloba.
I am the Founder of this Project (MindCare).
Mental Health became something i am passionate about when i was a student in Lagos State University.
I encoutered my first traumatic experience which made me fall back into a dark place with no access to professional help when i needed it.
This year i began to remininsce on this and i decided to put a team together to work on this open source vision.
I'm glad that people loved the idea and wanted to be part of it. 
I'm also welcoming anyone that shares the same perspective with me on this to join this project.
